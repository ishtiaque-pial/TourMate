# TourMate
This was an android apps. This apps was the data center of user travel information. 
This app sorts user travel information in a manner, which will give user a good experience. 
The functionality of Tourmate was designed according to the basic demands of user. 
Some of the functionalities were Travel expense tracker, Travel log management, Travel location weather update, nearby location of restaurant, cafe ATM etc.
In this app I used Yahoo weather API for weather information. I also used google maps API for location service. I used retrofit to parse JSON data.
